#GIS 501 - Lab 4 Question Ex 7 Q2

import arcpy    #imports necessary tools from arcgis

from arcpy import env    #sets the environment

env.workspace = "C:/EsriPress/Python/Data/Exercise07"    #creates a workspace

fc = "roads.shp"    # locates and identifes the shapefile

arcpy.AddField_management(fc, "FERRY", "TEXT", "", "", 20)    #Adds a text field

cursor = arcpy.da.UpdateCursor(fc, ["FEATURE", "FERRY"])    #Creates a cursor

for row in cursor:    #Identifies the row in cursor
    
    if row[0] == "Ferry Crossing":    #location confirmed if ferry crossing
    
        row[1] = "YES"    #yes iif true and it continues

    else:    #or if not ferry crossing
    
        row[1]= "NO"    #no is given

    cursor.updateRow(row)   #refreshes the fields for updated data

#Help from Sam, Bryan, James, and the book on this lab, without it I would have had way to much code to work properly
